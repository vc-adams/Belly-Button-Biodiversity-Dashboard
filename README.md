# Belly Button Biodiversity - Interactive_Visualizations

Built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset from http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/. The data catalogs the microbes that colonize in human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
